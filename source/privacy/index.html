<h1>Don Naipe Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><em>(last updated 16th November 2018)</em></p>

<p>Don Naipe respects your privacy. We are committed to protect your personal information. 
Don Naipe believes that users have the right to know which are the practices followed in 
their games regarding their personal information.</p>


<h2>GDPR</h2>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is designed to strengthen rights to 
privacy and is effective from 25th May 2018.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy shows what information is collected and what it is used for.</p>


<h2>Anonymous data</h2>
<p>Don Naipe may collect and use anonymous data through Google Analytics. We cannot 
identify you from this data that is only employed to get usage data of our games such as 
general statistics on our audience. This helps us to understand our players and to 
determine how to update our games in order to better support them.</p>


<h2>Emailed personal information</h2>
<p>Any personal information sent to us by email will be stored by our email systems. Your 
email address will be used to respond to your enquiries.</p>

<p>We will not ask for any personal information that we do not need.</p>

<p>If you are subscribed to our newsletter, we will send news about Don Naipe a few times 
a year. You can unsubscribe at any time using the link in any of our newsletters.</p>


<h2>Ad networks</h2>
<p>Our mobile games are supported by advertisements that are provided by third-party ad 
networks. These ad networks may employ identifiers assigned to your device that do not 
allow you to be identified as a person. These identifiers are used to provide personalized 
ads.</p>

<p>You can opt in or out of personalized ads at any time. If you opt out, you will still 
get ads in our games, but they will not be personalized for you.</p>

<p><strong>Opting out of personalized ads in Android devices:</strong>
